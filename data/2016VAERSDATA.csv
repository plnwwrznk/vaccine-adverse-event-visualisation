632623,KY,0.17,F,,,Y,Y,,,02/15/2016,02/15/2016,0,Raised rash all on top and sides of head, around and down to the middle of chest just above the belly button, on both fore arms, and  both legs. On the face she had also raised rash on her cheeks and both of her eyes were swollen and extremely red and the right eye was almost closed shut. Also, her eyes had a black/dark look, and she had a look in her eyes like help me something is wrong, and was spitting out her milk kind of fast and hard, like as if she had trouble swallowing. I called 911, ambulance was here by 3 minutes, they are 1 mile away and when the paramedics came in they stated she was definitely having an allergic reaction and we need to take her in to the ER. So they put her in ambulance and I road with her and we stayed at the hospital for about a total of 5 or 6 hours and the doctor ask did we think the rash was getting any better or was it getting worse while we wait in the hospital and it did not get worse but it did not get better over time, so the doctor gave patient some liquid Benadryl and a liquid steroid because she was not getting better and she still seemed to be in distressed. The medications seemed to help in about an hour we noticed she looked like she felt better but the rash didn't look better until the next day and did not fully go away to where you could see it until about 3 to 4 days.,,

Emergency Room Dr. determined it was a delayed reaction to the Gardasil shot that the had the week prior.  Patient is very healthy.  His blood pressure and heart rate were dangerously high and he lost control of his CNS, arms and legs were shaking uncontrollably.  It was very scary to watch and I am worried about any long-term effects.,,

She said she couldn't see, that everything was getting dark and that she had a loud ringing in her ears. She had to sit down. She wanted to go to sleep, but I encouraged her to stay awake and keep talking to me. It was hard to get her to respond. She was like that for about 15 minutes. Then she started talking a little bit but was still quite pale. She complained of a bad headache and stated she was very thirsty. Slowly she started to regain a more normal level of consciousness. This has happened 3 times since her vaccine. The date today is 6/2/16.,,

Then the Medical Assistant came in with the TDAP and stated that they no longer make the stand alone Tetanus shot.  The administrator told me the following week, after I'd gotten ill, that they didn't have any stand alone Tetanus boosters in stock at the time but do carry the vaccine. My immunization record shows where Dr. ordered a TDAP from Sanofi Pasteur and that the order was left incomplete.  The record then shows that Medical Assistant updated the order and administered the TDAP from the Manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline.,,

I'm 41 experiencing the exact symptoms and cannot get adequate health care anywhere in this country and I'm terrified that my life will end before age 42 thus resulting in the dramatic reduction of the life span of my kids. I know because I've had to be my own doctor, trial and error until I'm better and I need 30 fentanyl 100mcg DURAGESIC transdermal patches a month, femoral intramuscular injections 1 x's per 30 min to an hr, and oxycodone 80s x's 6per day as a means of stabilizing the damage caused by my primary care health care systems discontinuing my pain medication in April next appointment May 12,2016 9am arrived at 8:15 or so and told I was late so I refuted then staff said doc not there but he came out to ask a question, then told I was to difficult a patient and if I wanted my med refilled I had to wait till June 24, 2016 and when I refused and explained it was unconstitutional to cut me off cold turkey I was discharged from the practice completely.,,

That said, the vaccine is advertised to not give the flu to patients, however up to that point I had taken the flu shot 15 years out of 18 and within 8 hours have came down with severe cases of the flu.  The first time or so - it was blown off because you can't get the flu from the vaccine so I must have already came in contact with someone coming down with it or with the flu.  Year after year, however it has been evident that the flu vaccine causes be to have the flu.  I am not looking for anything here, I just want to know why this happens when you are not suppose to get the flu from the shot.  I have patient who ask if they should get the vaccine and I would like to be able to tell them something other than -- I don't take it anymore because I DO get the flu from the vaccine.  Thank you. In answering your questions, I can not give just one specific date, county, etc as there have been many. Counties vaccine administered... three counties. There have been many administrators, providers, and facilities.,,

I went to a medical clinic on 10/15/2016 to get it checked out, they determined I had an allergic reaction to getting the flu shot. (I went there because I had concerns that it might be cellulitis.) From the clinic's recommendations, I put hydrocortisone topically on the area, took BENADRYL at night and ZYRTEC in the morning. It has almost vanished today, which is 10/17/2016. It did not hurt, but it did slightly itch. (I am a employee and got this flu shot at one of the flu shot clinics.)",,

661729,MD,48.0,M,,,Y,,,,10/17/2016,10/17/2016,0,After the flu shot (Monday morning), I developed typical flu symptoms the next day with hoarseness, sore throat. Wednesday, the symptoms were getting worse with cough and fatigue. I thought all these were just normal minor flu shot reactions and thought it would go away soon.  Thursday, it got worse, I had headache in addition to the previous symptoms, plus coughing. I somehow realized the flu shot had compromised my immunity. Starting from Friday until Sunday, for three days I had continuous headache, fatigue, severe cough and green mucus, kind of infection with streptococcus, which was very common when immunity compromised. I could not get up for these three days, headache without appetite. I took Azithromycin (to treat a potential streptococcus infection) as well as Tylenol. The eighth day (next Monday), my headache got better, I did not cough that much, but would have lots of thick mucus in the nose until now (the tenth day, Wednesday), it continues. I went back health unit, the physician was out of office, I talked to the nurse, who did not understand why but doubted it might be caused by a coincidental cold or flu not yet protected by the flu shot on time.  I am not aware of any apparent catch of flu from my working or other environment the day got flu shot. Also I never had such a severe symptoms before, and I felt great the day I was taken the flu shot. As a doctor of medical science and an immunologist myself, I documented what has happened without going to a physician office during the weekend when I was most sick. I think the symptoms I reported are associated with the flu shot, but how exactly to interoperate it, I am not sure. Hope the report will add some information to any known adverse events who might be interested and looking for. Is the vaccine I received fully inactivated?I might got flu from the shot. Or does the flu shot compromise immunity in some degree or incur allergy in certain population?,,

665458,NH,41.0,F,,,,Y,,,11/08/2016,11/08/2016,0,Yes, within minutes before leaving the Dr office I experienced confusion and numbness followed by numbness on the left side of my face. I was told to go back to the exam room then became dizzy and the numbness ran through the rest of my face and whole body. My face felt warm and I had severe pain in my left arm (when lifting) where the injection was given. I was unable to drive and my speech was impaired. The Dr dismissed it as vasovagal. These symptoms subsided for a day and then returned on the 10th upon waking. My Dr concluded it had lasted too long to be vasovagal and sent me to the ER to be checked for a mini stroke. The CT scan reveled no signs of a stroke and blood work came out fine. The ER said it was a reaction to the Flu shot. I am continuing to have these symptoms as of today the 11th. I really hope this goes away soon!,,

I asked our family doctor to vaccinate me for three strains of flu and this I was told included the  flu vaccine. The left shoulder was bruised from the vaccine intially. I remember from my own father who was a physician until his own demise at age 86  in 2015 administering my vaccines as a child. He told me it was so important not to go too high on the arm. Years later, my own child was injured [January 2004 at Health Department] from flu vaccine injection. Cauterization was required to stop the bleeding, and this was requested by his pediatrician and done by a specialist. I know what happened in both instances, and I want to explain this to the CDC. My mother worked with the CDC for years. I work in my husband's medical practice, so I understand how important it is to explain what has happened. You can call me, and I will tell you the details. Then, you can instruct me on what to do. My son recovered from his injury after the bleeding [months later] was stopped. My father explained then the nurse used the wrong syringe and the wrong size [length] needle and went too high on the shoulder. I believe that a similar technique on my own shoulder during flu vaccine adminstration directly caused my current situation as well. I developed adhension capsulitis -- frozen shoulder. The details of this progression are exactly like the rare documented cases associated with influenza injection technique. I believe what has happened to me and the details of what has happened will be helpful to the CDC and that it is of the utmost importance that you understand what has happened so others will not be harmed. I  believe the doctor or administrating person of the vaccine should sit not stand while injecting as standing gives the administrator the disadvantage of proper angle and increases likelihood of injecting improperly -- hitting blood vessel, going too deeply, etc.,,
