This is an elongated and calcified ligament in the base of my skull that runs between my inner & outer carotid artery on the right side of my neck.  My Eagle's symtoms had been worse in 2019 eg  foreign body sensation in my throat, very tired and heavy feeling neck.  Over the past 9 years I  have been unable to hold my head to the right more than a few seconds without feeling uncomfortable and sometimes feeling like I could pass out.  I avoid turning my head sharply to the left because it makes the right side uncomfortable.  It feels like a twisting feeling.  This is NOT constant and since I avoid holding my head in those positions I did not have these sensations in December 2019.,,KNDA

876332,CA,67.0,F,,,,,,,01/28/2020,03/03/2020,35,A few days before the 1st dose of Shingrix, I had an outbreak of HSVI on my upper lip and took Valtrex. I did not have Valtrex within 24 hours of the 1st dose. After 1st dose of Shingrix, which I had at the same time as a flu vaccine, both on Sept 28, 2019, I felt fine other than muscle soreness in my arm from shots.   Jan 2-10, 2020, I had some type of flu with respiratory symptoms, muscle soreness, and great fatigue. Between Jan 11, 2020 and March 3, 2020, I felt fine.  I had 2nd dose of Shingrix on Jan 28, 2020, and felt muscle soreness in my arm. I had no problems until my left hand started itching, which was actually at the end of February, but a rash developed on March 3, 2020.,,I have many allergies to food and other products.

First Visit (10-18)  given Rx for DOXYCYCLINE twice daily for 10 days. On most recent visit had office fever of 100.2 as put in file.  That was AFTER I took fever reducer hours before going to doc.

So I went about my life despite feeling like crap for over a month.  Think I may have benefitted from 2nd round of antibitics as sputum dark and congeilled (strechy and gel like sputum). Charged me for Strep Test (good), refunded said ""you don't need it"". So I got a credit.",,None known.
